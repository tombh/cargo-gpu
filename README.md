# cargo-gpu

Command line tool for building Rust shaders using rust-gpu.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the tool ensure you have `rustup`. Then run:

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/rust-gpu/cargo-gpu
```

After that you can use `cargo gpu` to compile your shader crates with:

```
cargo gpu build
```

This plain invocation will compile the crate in the current directory and
place the compiled shaders in the current directory.

Use `cargo gpu help` to see other options :)

### Next Steps

You can try this out using the example repo at <https://github.com/rust-GPU/shader-crate-template>.
Keep in mind <https://github.com/rust-GPU/shader-crate-template> is _not_ yet a cargo generate template,
it's just a normal repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/rust-GPU/shader-crate-template
cd shader-crate-template
cargo gpu build
```

## How it works

Behind the scenes `cargo gpu` compiles a custom [codegen backend](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/codegen-backend.html)
for `rustc` that allows emitting [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) assembly, instead of the conventional LLVM assembly. SPIR-V is a dedicated
graphics language that is aimed to be open and portable so that it works with as many drivers and devices as possible.

With the custom codegen backend (`rustc_codegen_spirv`) `cargo gpu` then compiles the shader it is pointed to. However, because custom codegen backends
are currently [an unstable feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77933), `cargo gpu` also needs to install a "nightly" version of Rust. In
the usage instructions the backend and nightly Rust version are referred to as "artefacts" and can be explicitly managed with the arguments to the
`install` subcommand.

> [!TIP]
> Whilst `cargo gpu` attempts to isolate shader compilation as much possible, if the shader crate is contained in a workspace then it's possible that
> the nightly version required by the shader is, ironically, older than the Rust/Cargo versions required by the workspace. Say for instance the
> workspace might use a newer `Cargo.lock` layout not supported by the pinned version of the shader crate's custom codegen backend. The solution to
> this is to either exclude the shader from the workspace, or upgrade the shader's `spirv-std` dependency to the latest.

## Usage

All the following arguments for the `build` and `install` commands can also be set in the shader crate's `Cargo.toml`
file. In general usage that would be the recommended way to set config. See `crates/shader-crate-template/Cargo.toml`
for an example.

* Install
  Install rust-gpu compiler artifacts

  Usage: cargo-gpu install [OPTIONS]

  Options:
        --shader-crate <SHADER_CRATE>
            Directory containing the shader crate to compile

            [default: ./]

        --spirv-builder-source <SPIRV_BUILDER_SOURCE>
            Source of `spirv-builder` dependency Eg: "https://github.com/Rust-GPU/rust-gpu"

        --spirv-builder-version <SPIRV_BUILDER_VERSION>
            Version of `spirv-builder` dependency.
            * If `--spirv-builder-source` is not set, then this is assumed to be a crates.io semantic
              version such as "0.9.0".
            * If `--spirv-builder-source` is set, then this is assumed to be a Git "commitsh", such
              as a Git commit hash or a Git tag, therefore anything that `git checkout` can resolve.

        --rust-toolchain <RUST_TOOLCHAIN>
